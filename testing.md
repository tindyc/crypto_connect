**Warnings and Errors Fixed**



### Google Lighthouse Audit

I used Google's lighthouse audit in the Chrome DevTools to test the website conforms positively with Google's performance metrics.

After running the audit, the site received the below scores;
![Google Lighthouse Audit](assets/README/validation/gla.png)

This shows 90%+ scores for accessibility and best practices, but sub 90% in performance and SEO. 
Upon checking the reasoning for the low Performance and SEO scores, I decided to not take further action to improve the scores for the below reasons;

<details>
<Summary>Performance</Summary>

![Performance Score](assets/README/validation/google-lighthouse-audit/performance.PNG)

The driving factors to the low-performance score are the 'Eliminate Render Blocking Resources' and 'Remove Unused JavaScript'. However, the sources driving these are external resources, such as Materialize and jQuery. Therefore as the underlying cause is due to third party scripts, no further on-site optimisation is suitable.

</details>
<details>
<Summary>SEO</Summary>

![Performance Score](assets/README/validation/google-lighthouse-audit/SEO.PNG)

The two driving factors in the low SEO score are 'uncrawlable links' and 'robots.txt is not valid'. 
The uncrawable links are the pagination links on the recipes page, which are auto-generated by flask-pagination. These links are not necessarily needed for crawling, as a properly optimised robots.txt file will ensure each recipe page (recipe-details) would be crawled by search engines.

The invalid robots.txt is being flagged, as no robots.txt file has been created. The purpose of a robots.txt file to provide search engines information on your site and directions on how to crawl your pages.  If this project were for commercial or public purposes, an optimised robots.txt file would be an important inclusion. 

However, as this is a personal project, not meant for discovery on search engines, no robots.txt should be created.

## Responsive Device & Browser Testing

To test the responsiveness of the site I used [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) and [Responsive Design Checker](https://www.responsivedesignchecker.com/).

### Responsiveness
![Desktop Responsive Testing](assets/README/validation/responsiveness/desktop.PNG)

![Tablet Responsive Testing](assets/README/validation/responsiveness/tablet.PNG)

![Mobile Responsive Testing](assets/README/validation/responsiveness/mobile.PNG)

To ensure responsive design, I used materialize grid, flexbox, containers and custom media queries to ensure all site pages resized responsively for all mainstream device viewports.

### Browser Compatibility

## Testing User Stories


## Issues I had to overcome
**User Image Upload**:

   

## Issues still to overcome
**Forgotten Password**:

   Currently, there is no function to help users recover a password if it is forgotten. This can be added in the future, via the integration of an e-mail system to send users account verification and reset password links.
